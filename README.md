# How To Use

This repository contains multiple [branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches). Every branch represents a course section and contains the resources that belong to that section.

For example, the branch [02-testing-basics](https://github.com/fahimjason/js-test/tree/02-testing-basics) contains all resources (e.g., code snapshots) that belong to the branch [01-setup](https://github.com/fahimjason/js-test/tree/01-setup).

You can switch branches via the dropdown in the top left corner of this repository page.

# Using Code Snapshots

You can either view my code directly here on Github (you can open + view code files without issues here) or you download the snapshots. To download (or [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)) the snapshots, simply use the **"Code" button** in the top right corner of the repository. This allows you to download the currently selected branch. You can then browse the code snapshots locally on your machine.

# Running The Provided Code

You can run my project code by navigating into the respective code snapshots subfolder (i.e., a folder in the `/root` folder) and executing `npm install` followed by `npm test` there.

    example

    # open new terminal
    $ cd basic-testing-nodejs
    $ npm install
    $ npm test
